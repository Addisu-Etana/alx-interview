### 0x07. Rotate 2D Matrix

- For the “0. Rotate 2D Matrix” project, you are tasked with implementing an in-place algorithm to rotate an n x n 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise. This challenge requires a good understanding of matrix manipulation and in-place operations in Python. Below are the key concepts and resources that you need to grasp in order to successfully complete this project.

### Concepts Needed:

 1. Matrix Representation in Python:

 - Understanding how 2D matrices are represented using lists of lists in Python.
 - Accessing and modifying elements in a 2D matrix.

 2. In-place Operations:

 - Performing operations on data without creating a copy of the data structure.
 - The importance of minimizing space complexity by modifying the matrix in place

  3. Matrix Transposition:

  - Understanding the concept of transposing a matrix (swapping rows and columns).
  - Implementing matrix transposition as a step in the rotation process.

  4. Reversing Rows in a Matrix:

  - Manipulating rows of a matrix by reversing their order as part of the rotation process.
Nested Loops:

   - Using nested loops to iterate through 2D data structures like matrices.
   - odifying elements within nested loops to achieve the desired rotation.

### Resources:

 - Python Official Documentation:

Data Structures (list comprehensions, nested list comprehension)
